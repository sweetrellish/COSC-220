"D and Q Sequences"- Output and Observations

Main Program:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

long D(long);
long Q(long);

int main(){

     int input;
     cout<< "---D and Q Sequences---"<<endl;
    cout<< "Input n: ";
    cin>>input;
    
    cout<<"Q Numbers: ";
    for (int i = 0; i < input; i++)
       cout<< Q(i) << " ";
    cout<<"D Numbers: ";
    for (int i = 0; i < input; i++)
        cout<< D(i)<< " ";
     return 0;
}

long D(long n){
    return D(D(n-1)) + D(n - 1 - D(n - 2));
    
} 

long Q(long n){
    return Q(n - Q(n - 1)) + Q(n - Q(n - 2));
    
}

Output:

---D and Q Sequences---

Segmentation fault


Observations:
This code immediately runs into a segmentation fault with not any evidence that there was any calculation done whatsoever. Stack overflow issue, need to add stop conditions.
